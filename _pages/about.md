# About Me

I am a PhD student at Stanford where I'm very fortunate to be advised by [Ramesh Johari](https://web.stanford.edu/~rjohari/) and [Irene Lo](https://sites.google.com/view/irene-lo/home?authuser=0), and to work closely with [Gabriel Weintraub](https://gsb-faculty.stanford.edu/gabriel-weintraub/). I grew up in Michigan and completed my B.S. in Applied Math and CS at Columbia University. Up until the beginning of grad school I was primarily interested in Probability Theory and Theoretical CS, but now I am mostly interested in using techniques from these areas to study problems at the intersection of Market Design and Data Science. At Stanford, I am affiliated with the [Operations Research](https://or.stanford.edu/) group in the MS&E department, the [Data Science Center](https://datascience.stanford.edu/about/about-stanford-data-science), and the [Society and Algorithms Lab](https://web.stanford.edu/group/soal/). I'm also thankful to be supported by a Stanford Data Science Scholarship, NSF Graduate Fellowship, and an EDGE Doctoral Fellowship.
