# About Me

I am a PhD student at Stanford where I'm very fortunate to be advised by [Ramesh Johari](https://web.stanford.edu/~rjohari/) and [Irene Lo](https://sites.google.com/view/irene-lo/home?authuser=0), and to work closely with [Gabriel Weintraub](https://gsb-faculty.stanford.edu/gabriel-weintraub/). I grew up in Michigan and completed my B.S. in Applied Math and CS at Columbia University. Up until the beginning of grad school I was primarily interested in Probability Theory and Theoretical CS, but now I am mostly interested in using techniques from these areas to study problems in Contract Theory and Market Design. At Stanford, I am affiliated with the [Operations Research](https://or.stanford.edu/) group in the MS&E department, the [Data Science Center](https://datascience.stanford.edu/about/about-stanford-data-science), and the [Society and Algorithms Lab](https://web.stanford.edu/group/soal/). I'm also thankful to be supported by a Stanford Data Science Scholarship, NSF Graduate Fellowship, and an EDGE Doctoral Fellowship.

# Research Interests
A consistent theme of my research is using stochastic modeling to evaluate and improve market operations. I typically use techniques from queueing theory and dynamic optimization to study two different sorts of questions: (1) how should market policies be designed for resource-constrained settings? And, (2) how should the data science methods used to improve these policies be designed? I enjoy working on applications with a social good impact, and I've been particularly interested in sustainability and education. Two distinct (but not necessarily disjoint) themes in my research are:

- **Causal Inference and Experimentation in Marketplaces**: I am excited about using stochastic modeling of marketplace dynamics to design causal inference methods that can handle dynamic interference and dynamic treatment effects. So far, I have worked on A/B testing in online marketplaces, with a focus on how interference affects decision-making from a hypothesis testing perspective. Going forward, I'm very interested in designing methods for dynamic measurement and experimentation in education technology.
- **Market Design for Social Good**: I am also excited about using game theoretic modeling to study public sector markets that deal with severe information asymmetries and resource constraints, where it is crucial to design policies that are simple, informationally robust, and equitable. So far, I've studied Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) programs and worked on simple yet approximately optimal dynamic contract design. I'm also interested in applying these methods and questions to education settings.

I'm lucky to have interacted with some great companies during my research, including Airbnb and [Edmentum](https://www.edmentum.com/).
