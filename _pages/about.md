# About Me

I am a PhD student at Stanford where I'm very fortunate to be advised by [Ramesh Johari](https://web.stanford.edu/~rjohari/) and [Irene Lo](https://sites.google.com/view/irene-lo/home?authuser=0), and to work closely with [Gabriel Weintraub](https://gsb-faculty.stanford.edu/gabriel-weintraub/). I grew up in Michigan and completed my B.S. in Applied Math and CS at Columbia University. Up until the beginning of grad school I was primarily interested in Probability Theory and Theoretical CS, but now I am mostly interested in using techniques from these areas to study problems in Contract Theory and Market Design. At Stanford, I am affiliated with the [Operations Research](https://or.stanford.edu/) group in the MS&E department, the [Data Science Center](https://datascience.stanford.edu/about/about-stanford-data-science), and the [Society and Algorithms Lab](https://web.stanford.edu/group/soal/). I'm also thankful to be supported by a Stanford Data Science Scholarship, NSF Graduate Fellowship, and an EDGE Doctoral Fellowship.

# Research Interests
Most of my research interests lie in using tools from applied probability, algorithms, and statistical theory to study questions at the intersection of market design and data science. In one direction, I am interested in the use of data science tools to design economic mechanisms, and the resulting sample complexity and efficiency guarantees. In another direction, I am interested in the incentives of economic agents involved in statistical tests, and how they can result in biased estimates as well as undesirable market outcomes. From a methodological standpoint I am also interested in simplicity and robustness as tools for mechanism design. I am especially excited when the questions I'm studying have applications to operations and resource allocation in online platforms, the environment, and education. Right now, I have worked on two projects:

- **Simplicity and Robustness in Contract Design for Sustainability**: In this project, we study dynamic contract models motivated by Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) programs, where governments and NGOs pay landowners to maintain their land sustainably. We design dynamic contracts with simple payment structure that can achieve constant factor approximations of the optimal contract payoff. This tradeoff on simplicity vs. robustness is especially salient in developing world settings where contracts need to be simple enough for the participating agents to understand while still achieving a good outcome with respect to the optimal payment structure.
- **Bias from Experimentation in Online Platforms**: We study the problem of A/B testing run by a two-sided online marketplace, and we focus on characterizing bias that results from estimating the variance of the estimated treatment effect. This allows us to quantify the effect of interference on the platform's decisions to launch features.
