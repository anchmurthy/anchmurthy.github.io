 I'm a fourth year PhD Candidate at Stanford University, where I'm advised by Ramesh Johari and Gabriel Weintraub. I'm part of the Operations Research group in MS&E and the Society and Algorithms Lab. 

My research is centered around the design and optimization of online marketplaces. In particular, I focus on developing statistical methodology for experimentation on these platforms, in the presence of interference. I combine techniques from statistics, causal inference, economics, and operations research to develop theoretical insights for practically motivated problems. 

I inform my research with first hand experience working on these platforms. I interned for the data science teams at Airbnb and Opendoor, where I worked on market related causal inference questions.

Before coming to Stanford, I graduated from Pomona College with a degree in mathematics.
