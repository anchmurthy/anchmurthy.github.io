# About Me

Hi! I'm a fifth year PhD Candidate at Stanford University, where I'm advised by [Ramesh Johari](http://web.stanford.edu/~rjohari/) and [Gabriel Weintraub](https://gweintra.people.stanford.edu/). **I am on the 2021-22 job market.** I'm part of the [Operations Research](https://or.stanford.edu/) group in MS&E and the [Society and Algorithms Lab](https://soal.stanford.edu/). Before coming to Stanford, I graduated from Pomona College with a degree in mathematics. 

My research is centered around the design and optimization of online marketplaces. In particular, I focus on developing statistical methodology for experimentation on these platforms, in the presence of interference. I combine techniques from statistics, causal inference, economics, and operations research to develop theoretical insights for practically motivated problems. 

I inform my research with first hand experience working on these platforms. I interned for the data science teams at [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/) and [Opendoor](https://www.opendoor.com/), where I worked on market related causal inference questions. 

I am also interested in using operations research techniques to design accessible education systems, both on the theory and application side. I am working with the [Common App](https://www.commonapp.org/) to build data-driven tools to improve the equity and access of higher education.
