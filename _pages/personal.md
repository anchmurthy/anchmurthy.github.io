Some of my favorite hobbies are listening to music and playing the violin. At Stanford, I'm super lucky to study with [Debra Fong](https://music.stanford.edu/people/debra-fong), and I also love playing in chamber ensembles and orchestras. Many of my most precious moments and friends have come from making music, and I especially have a lot fond memories from playing in my high school orchestra. Miraculously, there are still videos on the internet of us performing from my junior and senior years. Some special pieces of music with some very special people :)

I've been a classical music nerd for a long time, and I think the composers who have had the biggest impact on me are Tchaikovsky, Rimsky-Korsakov, Sibelius, Elgar, Vaughan-Williams, Mahler, and Debussy. I listen to a lot of other types of music too, and some artists that are special to me include Big Thief, SZA, Sade, Talking Heads, Sufjan Stevens, Nai Palm, Still Woozy, Kali Uchis, Little Simz, and The Internet. I'm lucky to have seen a lot of concerts around NYC and the Bay Area, and I'm starting to catalogue them in more detail because I'm starting to lose track of them...
